This morning as I prepare to venture out into the world and fulfill the responsibilities I've chosen for myself it seems appropriate to mention why I chose the responsibility of bitcoin brunch.


Throughout my life I\'ve found some occasion, though not regularly, to
publicly express my stong opinions in a way I hope might have an impact.
In all those instances I latched on to someone else\'s movement; joined
their movement in attempt to make my impact through their methodology.
Having learned through customer service and sales job that one should
under-promise so they can over-deliver, in having the utopian cart
before the horse, all these movements failed to meet my hopes.

Earlier this year as I noted a cultural trend towards crypto the
proletariate social justice warrior in me jabbered ad neuseam about the
potential impending catastrophe of widespread altcoin adoption.

I write altcoins because when I first learned about bitcoin shitcoins
didn\'t exist, ICOs hadn\'t happened yet, in fact, Ethereum was just a
promise, not a protocol. Through the past decade of so much wild
technological change, one thing remains constant: how I feel about
bitcoin.

Therefore, bitcoin brunch is an attempt to under-promise myself an
aspiration of helping reshape this insane world with the creative
potential bitcoin can unleash; to do some bare minimum, but consistently
do it. And I have done this every Sunday I\'ve been in Miami since I
started this, shortly after the Miami Crypto Experience.

It has over-delivered. I look forward to more and more!
